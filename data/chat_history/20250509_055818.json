    "content": "The most expensive cheese in the world is often considered to be Pule cheese. Pule is a rare Serbian cheese made from the milk of Balkan donkeys, which are found at the Zasavica Special Nature Reserve in Serbia. The production of Pule cheese is extremely labor-intensive, as it takes about 25 liters of donkey milk to produce just one kilogram of cheese. Due to its rarity and the effort required to produce it, Pule cheese can cost around $1,000 to $1,300 per kilogram, making it one of the priciest cheeses in the world.",
