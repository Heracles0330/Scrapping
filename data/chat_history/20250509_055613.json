    "content": "The most expensive cheese in the world is Pule cheese, which is priced at around $600 to $1,300 per pound. Pule is a rare Serbian cheese made from the milk of Balkan donkeys, which are native to Serbia and Montenegro. The high cost is due to the labor-intensive process and the fact that donkey milk is low in yield and high in nutritional content, requiring a large quantity to produce a small amount of cheese. Additionally, there are only a few farms that produce this cheese, further contributing to its exclusivity and high price.",
