    "content": "The most expensive cheese in the world is Pule cheese, which is made in Serbia. This rare cheese is produced from the milk of Balkan donkeys at a farm in the Zasavica Special Nature Reserve. The process is labor-intensive, requiring about 25 liters of donkey milk to produce just one kilogram of cheese. Due to its rarity and the difficulty in production, Pule cheese can sell for around $1,000 per kilogram, making it the priciest cheese available. Its unique flavor and scarcity contribute to its high value.",
